Simple python program that tests your typing speed

For it to work it will prompt you for a pathway to the designated textfile.
It can be any text file but you can use the ones that I have left inside.
The pathway should be something like: ...\assignment4\TypeTest1.txt

example: C:\Users\(user)\OneDrive\Documents\(txt file)
